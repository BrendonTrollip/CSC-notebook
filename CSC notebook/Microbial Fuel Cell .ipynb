    "The operating principle comprises of the division of the half reactions of oxidation and reduction in two seperate compartments. In the anodic compartment, electroactive bacteria catalyse substrate by oxidation in anaerobic conditions and transfer the electrons to the electrode. These electrones then flow through an external electrical circuit to the cathodic compartment where oxygen is the electron acceptor and reduced in aerobic conditions. To ensure neutralilty, the $H^{+}$ flows through a cation permeable membrane to the cathodic compartment.  "
